Overview
Farmer John has just purchased one of those new-fangled computers. He needs you to create a report to help him with his livestock.
He has pigs, goats, and sheep. The livestock is valued based on their individual weight. He identifies them by name. He would also like to keep track of their ages and gender. The animal's value is based on the price that the market pays per pound multiplied by weight.
Genesis
Being the helpful software engineer you are, you set him up with a database to hold this data. Use the relational database of your choice. (Be sure to choose one that supports SQL queries) Draw the database diagram for the database that you designed for him.
Reckoning
Farmer John is not impressed by your talk of tables and joins and wants a quick report right now to identify the most valuable animal. Write a query (in SQL) that will produce a list of the animals, and their value, in the following format:
animal type : animal name : gender : weight : rate : total value
Order them by total value with the most valuable animal first.
Perseverance
The results of your query were very impressive, but he is a bit obsessive. He keeps calling in the middle of the night to have you run the query. That has to stop, so you wrote a program to produce the following report: 
Goat  	Ginnie Mae  	Female  	100lbs  	$0.25/lb  	$25.00
Using Perl, write a program that will create a report in the format above
If you have a stronger language, you can certainly also implement the report in that language if you think it will help us to get to know you better.
